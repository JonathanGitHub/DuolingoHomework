DuolingoHomework
================

1) The project is built by NetBeans and a number of external jar files are integrated. So testers have to use NetBean to run the project.  

2) The project is tuned to support English language only. If a user input Spanish or Japanese, then we have to pass a different parameter to “DuolingoGrader.java” file

3) Run the DuolingoHomework java file.
